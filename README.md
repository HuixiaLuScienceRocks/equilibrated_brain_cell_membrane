## This repository contains files of the equilibrated brain cell membrane (BPM)

# For broader applications of the pre-equilibrated BPM, you may wish to merge it with molecules of interest. Before doing so, be sure to verify the coordinates of the lipid identified as chain G / resname CER160.

### Note that in VMD the GLPA lipid’s resname appears as CER160, whereas in the corresponding PDB file it is written simply as CER1. As a result, when using VMD’s Merge Structures module, the program cannot correctly process these lipids and will place all GLPA lipid atoms at the origin (0.00 0.00 0.00).

And BPM is equilibrated at 300 K and 100 ns of production runs after a series of equilibration runs. The composition of BPM provided here, please check this reference:
